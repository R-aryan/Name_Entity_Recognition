# Name Entity Recognition

Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity extraction) is a sub-task of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as the person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.



# Problem Description

Clinical studies often require detailed patientsâ€™ information documented in clinical narratives. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) task to extract entities of interest (e.g., disease names, medication names and lab tests) from clinical narratives, thus to support clinical and translational research. Clinical notes have been analyzed in greater detail to harness important information for clinical research and other healthcare operations, as they depict rich, detailed medical information.
